Here’s a **concise, structured summary** of the **assignment requirements** and **our implementation plan**, clearly mapped point by point:

---

### ✅ **Assignment Requirements (as given)**

* **🎵 Music Library UI**:

  * Display list of songs
  * Filter, sort, and group by Album, Artist, Title using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

* **🧩 Micro Frontend Architecture**:

  * Split into:

    * **Main App** (container)
    * **Music Library** (remote microfrontend)
  * Use **Module Federation** (Webpack or Vite-compatible)

* **🔐 Auth & Role Management**:

  * Mock JWT, stored in memory (or localStorage/context)
  * Roles:

    * `admin`: Can add/delete
    * `user`: View-only
  * Role-based UI visibility

* **🚀 Deployment**:

  * Deploy **Main App** and **Music Library** separately
  * Ensure MF integration works across deployments
  * Use **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**

* **⚙️ Technical Guidelines**:

  * React functional components + hooks
  * Routing optional
  * Simple styling (CSS/Tailwind/etc.)
  * State: useState / useReducer / Context (no Redux)
  * Use Vite/Webpack, lazy-load microfrontend

* **📦 Deliverables**:

  * GitHub repo with README:

    * How to run locally
    * Deployment instructions
    * Demo creds (`admin`, `user`)
    * How auth + microfrontend work
  * Live links: Main App + Microfrontend

### 🛠️ **Implementation Plan (Full-Stack Approach)**

#### 🧱 **Main App (Container)**

* Handles:

  * `/login`, `/signup`, `/music` routes
  * Cookie-based JWT auth (via Express backend)
  * Role & user stored in React context
  * Loads Music Library using Module Federation
  * Passes `role` and `user` as props
  * Guards protected routes (`/music`) with `<PrivateRoute />`

#### 🎧 **Microfrontend (Music Library UI)**

* Receives `role` and `user` props from Main
* Displays song list
* Filters, sorts, groups using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
* Makes API calls to backend using cookie-based JWT
* Enables add/delete buttons only if role is `admin`
* Blocks/redirects direct access if loaded without props

#### 🔙 **Backend (Express + Prisma + NeonDB)**

* Handles:

  * `/login`, `/signup`, `/me` endpoints (JWT in cookies)
  * `/songs` CRUD routes (with role checks)
* Deployed via Render/Railway with CORS + cookie support

#### ☁️ **Deployment Plan**

* Deploy **Main App** (Vercel/Netlify)
* Deploy **Music Library** (separately) with `remoteEntry.js`
* Backend hosted on Render/Railway
* NeonDB used for persistent Postgres storage
